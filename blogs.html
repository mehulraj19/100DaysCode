                <h1>Day1 (27, November, 2020)</h1>
            <p>
                Today, I have developed weather App in flutter using openWeatherapi key to get the temperature and city name using latitude and longitude. 
                This app works well and I have added multiple functionalities in the app. So, the app by default uses GPS location to 
                get the current location of the user and tells weather accordingly. Secondly, it is worth to note that the location
                that is being used have been implemented to make sure that it wont't drain out battery. Then, also we have given
                choice to user to get the we of the city that the user wishes for.

            <h1>Day2 (28, November, 2020)</h1>
            <p>
                Today, I have developed a bitcoin App that uses the api for Bitcoin and gives the value of BTC, LTC and ETH for different currency in the dropdown.
                The App gives the current data of the price of bitcoin in different currencies. Now, when we are talking about bitcoin, there are in
                total three types that I have mentioned before, LTC, BTC and ETH and all these three changes will be shown.
            </p>

            <h1>Day3 (29, November, 2020)</h1>
            <p>
                Today, I have worked on Chat Application where I have worked on setting up Application to firebase and how to get animations in app.
                There are multiple screens in the App:
                <ol>
                    <li>Welcome Screen (Main Screen)</li>
                    <li>Register Screen</li>
                    <li>Login Screen</li>
                    <li>Chat Screen</li>
                </ol>
                After this to make app to have a better User Experience, Animations have been added, the color chosen are also subtle.
            </p>

            <h1>Day4 (30, November, 2020)</h1>
            <p>
                Today, I have worked more on Chat Application and have focused mainly on connecting App with Firebase Database: firestore. This includes adding users based
                on email and password and then using firebase database to connect it to database and doing both creating and reading the data from the database.
                Since, this is Chat App, it is important for the changes in the screen to be shown just after new data has been inserted, thus used concepts of
                stream for this. All this is included to give the final touch have worked more on Chat_Screen UI.
            </p>
